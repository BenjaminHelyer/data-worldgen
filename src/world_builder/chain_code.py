def generate_uuidv7() -> UUID:
    """
    Generates a UUID which is similar to UUIDv7. UUIDv7 is a UUID variant that includes a timestamp.

    Essentially UUIDv7 is timestamp + random sequence, with a few other added bits.
    Due to the fact that the unique identifier is prefaced by a timestamp, monotonicity is in some situations garunteed.
    This can eable quicker INSERT operations on a database (in a typical case, INSERTs would simply be an append if the UUID is used as a primary key).
    Indexing and partitioning can also be improved if one uses UUIDv7 as a primary key, rather than a completely random UUID.

    Returns:
        UUID: The generated UUIDv7.
